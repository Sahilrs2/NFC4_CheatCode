# Chatbot Integration Documentation

## Overview
The chatbot component has been successfully integrated with the `GeminiCareerMentorAPIView` backend API. Users can now have real-time conversations with an AI career mentor.

## Backend Integration

### API Endpoint
- **URL**: `/api/ai-mentor/`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**: `{ "question": "user question here" }`
- **Response**: `{ "response": "AI generated response" }`

### Backend Files Modified
- `Backend/api/views.py` - Contains the `GeminiCareerMentorAPIView` class
- `Backend/api/urls.py` - Routes the `/ai-mentor/` endpoint
- `Backend/api/utils/gemini_utils.py` - Contains the Gemini AI integration

## Frontend Integration

### Files Modified
1. **`frontend/nfc_f/src/services/api.js`**
   - Added `aiMentorAPI` object with `getResponse()` method
   - Handles API calls to the backend

2. **`frontend/nfc_f/src/pages/chatbot.jsx`**
   - Integrated with the AI mentor API
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Improved user experience with real-time responses

### Key Features Added
- **Real-time AI responses**: Messages are sent to the backend and processed by Gemini AI
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback while waiting for AI response
- **Error handling**: Graceful error messages if API calls fail
- **Improved UX**: Disabled inputs during loading, better message display

## How It Works

1. User types a message in the chatbot interface
2. Frontend sends the message to `/api/ai-mentor/` endpoint
3. Backend processes the message using Gemini AI
4. AI response is returned to the frontend
5. Response is displayed in the chat interface

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/nfc_f
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to the chatbot page and start a conversation

4. Optional: Run the test script:
   ```bash
   node test-chatbot-integration.js
   ```

## Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network errors are caught and displayed to the user
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous requests
- Graceful fallback messages for failed API calls

## Security Considerations

- CORS is properly configured for localhost development
- API endpoints are protected with appropriate permissions
- No sensitive data is exposed in the frontend

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Message history persistence
- User authentication integration
- Typing indicators
- File upload support
- Conversation context management
